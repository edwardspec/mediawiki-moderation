TODO:

Medium-prio:
* (testsuite) Provide ~100% automated test coverage of all functionality.

Low-prio:
* (feature) Intercept renaming of pages.
* (feature) Provide flexible handling of zero edits, for example suppress if
	there is no edit comment, mark them with "is zero edit" flag viewable
	to the moderator, add an option (disabled by default) to suppress
	zero edits completely, etc.
* (interface) For non-automoderated users: show a message on their
	Special:Contributions ensuring them that their edits will
	appear there when they are approved.
* (interface) Perform the actions like Approve via Ajax (without leaving Special:Moderation).
	Partially implemented ($wgModerationUseAjax), but we need some feedback
	from users on UX (is it convenient to use or not?)
* (testsuite) Troubleshoot session-related issues in "Internal invocation" mode.
	Currently preload-related tests don't succeed in this mode,
	because PHP session is not properly preserved before/after pcntl_fork().

Background-prio (may not be needed):
* (interface) For each folder, display the number of new entries there
	in the last day and week.

FIXME:
* tags assigned by Extension:AbuseFilter are not applied after Approve.

Tests needed:
* API: api.php?action=moderation
