--	"moderation" table lists:
--	1) not yet approved changes,
--	2) rejected changes (for some period of time)
--
--	It does NOT list approved changes or logs.
--	"Who approved what" is in the general logging table.
--
--	This table is very similar to the recentchanges table.
--
--	NOTE: changes to the text are represented by the resulting text
--	(mod_text). If other edits were made to the page in question
--	(while this edit was awaiting moderation), a unified diff
--	will be generated and the newest revision will be patched.
