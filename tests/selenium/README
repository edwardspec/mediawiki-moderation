This is the Selenium testsuite of Extension:Moderation.

== Purpose ==

This testsuite ensures that Moderation works with JavaScript-based editors
of Extension:VisualEditor and Extension:MobileFrontend.

This is ONLY for tests which require executing JavaScript in the browser.
Everything else should be in the PHPUnit testsuite (see README.testsuite).

== Needed tests ==

1) notify: after saving the edit, you should see "Success: your edit
has been sent to moderation" message (instead of the usual postedit message).

2) ajaxhook: when you save an edit in VisualEditor/MobileFrontend, they should
be fooled into thinking that the edit was saved successfully (instead of
freaking out "Unknown error: moderation-edit-queued").

3) preload: when you open an editor of VisualEditor/MobileFrontend while your
previous edit on this page is still awaiting moderation, the text of your
version should be substituted into the edit form.

== How to run ==

To run this testsuite, you need the following:

* Selenium: http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/
* chromedriver: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
* geckodriver: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
* Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

On most Linux distributions, these are available as packages.

Before you start the testsuite, run Selenium server in background:
	java -jar /usr/local/selenium-server-standalone-3.4.0.jar
(change path and version in this command)

To install the testsuite (only needed once):
	1) enter [tests/selenium] directory under [extensions/Moderation].
	2) run the following:
		npm install

To run the tests:
	1) enter [tests/selenium] directory under [extensions/Moderation].
	2) run the following:
		./node_modules/.bin/wdio --baseUrl 'http://hostname.of.your.wiki'

NOTE: when testing locally, you shouldn't minimize Firefox during the tests,
because Firefox requires the window to be in focus to simulate the clicks in it.

== Customizing ==

See http://webdriver.io/guide/testrunner/configurationfile.html
Configuration file is [extensions/Moderation/tests/selenium/wdio.conf.js]

== Known issues ==

MobileFrontend for MediaWiki 1.29 has a bug that interferes with the testsuite.
The following patch must be applied:
	https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/363012/
This is only needed for MediaWiki 1.29 (not <= 1.28 or 1.30+).
